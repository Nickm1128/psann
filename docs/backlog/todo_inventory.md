## Issue triage guidance

Create GitHub issues for:
- Tasks with clear acceptance criteria and an execution plan.
- Multi-step refactors or experiments that benefit from discussion.
- Bugs or regressions tied to a reproducible report.

Keep in docs:
- Long-form research notes, one-off plans, or historical context.
- Checklists that need to stay bundled with documentation (e.g. this cleanup list).
